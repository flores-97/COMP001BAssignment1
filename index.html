        <p class="question">What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>
        <p>One of the first things I hope to learn in this class is how to properly format a webpage, make it look neat, and continue to learn new skills
            that I can use in my future career. Although I am just in my second class of leaning how to code, I feel that I have learned so much and I know I have barely scratched the surface. </p>
        
            <p>One of the things I struggle with the most is making a webpage look organized. I hope to learn how to properly grid, learn layouts, and overall make 
            a webpage actually look organized. So far I only know how to stack elements on more 
            elements, but I want to make boxes of text and organize them so that its not words on top of more words
        </p>

        <p>As I said before, I have only started on my path to a new career and I already feel like I have learned a lot.
            With all the tags, elements, and everything else in HTMl I know it will be a while before I can memorize what everything does. By far my favorite tool 
            is the emmet shortcuts. It helps when creating list and tables.
