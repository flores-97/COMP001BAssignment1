        <p>My name is Victor Flores and I am from Sacramento, California. After graduating high school I was not sure what I wanted to do 
            so I called one of my friends that had enlisted in the US Navy and ask him how it was. He told me that it has been amazing so far, and the next 
            day without much thought, I walked into a recruiter's office and signed a four year contract. That was in 2016 and I am currently still serving. 
        </p>

        <p>So far in my 8 year career I have made lifelong friends, traveled around the world, and deployed only once. I would say my career has been lucky so far.
            I was able to make rank very fast that ended up putting me in leadership positions really early that stressed me out. I found it more difficult to manage people 
            than it was to maintain an aircraft, but just like anything, it takes some practice and some failures to figure out how to do things right.
        </p>

        <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include playing soccer, building Legos, hanging out with my dogs, and travel with my wife. my wife and I have been together since 2018 and we have traveled to many states
            east and west coast. By far my favorite state so far has been Washington state because of its nature and cities. I feel like it is a perfect balance. My favorite country is Japan with Philippines as 
            close second.
